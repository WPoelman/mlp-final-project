# mlp-final-project
Final project for the course Machine Learning Project

## Usage
- Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Unzip the dataset in `data` or download from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arushchillar/disneyland-reviews)
- Run `main.py <path to dataset>`

When running the script, a cache file of the dataset `dataset_cache.pickle` is created in order to reduce the loading times for subsequent times the script is ran.
