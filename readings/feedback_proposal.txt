RQ a bit vague

Motivation for the task OK but not included for the dataset. 	
	Overall clear but papers about classifiers and their application to sentiment classification are mixed in the discussion. The discussion of the literature could be organised better.

Good to connect the discussion to your choices, e.g. about KNN. 	
	Clear. In the project report you can include a table that shows how many reviews there are, average rating, etc. Maybe even show 1 example of positive and 1 of negative reviews. 	
	Overall clear. It just adds word embeddings to what done in assingment 1. The addition of word embeddings is well motivated. Being a group of 3 you could do something extra. Some ideas:
- Cast the problem as regression, so you predict a real number.
- Use additional non-textual features in the classifier, e.g. park, nationality.

The motivation of the classifiers could be more explicit, why SVM and KNN?

Since you split the data, it would be better to have not only train and test but also dev. 	
	Overall clear.

There is no analysis we could be insightful. E.g. look at missclassified reviews for which the classifier is very confident and very unconfident.

Establishing a performance goal based on another dataset is problematic. Since the dataset is public you could compare to previous classifiers on the dataset you use.

movie reviews? 	
	Overall good. A few minor issues:
- The paper from Basari et al. (2013) uses → Basari et al. (2013) use
by Kalaivani and
Shunmuganathan (2013); - Basari et al. (2013); Se et al. (2016) → by Kalaivani and Shunmuganathan (2013), Basari et al. (2013) and Se et al. (2016)
- Se et al. (2016) states → Se et al. (2016) state 	
	the title could be more informative

Some parts could be better. E.g.
- has been increasing attention → has received increasing attention
- makes the greatest
accuracy outcomes → achieves the highest accuracy.
- be a detrimental → be detrimental
- lower → lowercase

If you introduced an acronym (e.g. SVM) use the acronym afterwards and not the full form.

42.000 → 42,000

“Good enough” sounds too vague and informal
