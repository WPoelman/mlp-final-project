"1,5,2021-1,Canada,""We can’t wait to go back. I was lucky enough to take my family just before covid hit North America hard and shut the parks down. It is truly the most magical place on earth. Dreams came true and the magic was everywhere."",Disneyland_California"
"2,5,2020-12,United States,""The one and only, the original theme park, Disneyland. It's pricey in a little campy but it's one of those things you have to say you've done once in your life. And I'm not talking about the fake one over in Orlando. I'm talking about the real thing down in Anaheim. I don't care how old you are it will take you back to your childhood and that's the whole point I think. And if you have children this is definitely I'm about to do. But, be prepared to pay an arm and a leg to do it"",Disneyland_California"
"3,2,2020-3,United States,""My family and I visit annually and drive 6 hrs in order to do so. March 10th was a rainy day, which we planned for. But the wait to get into the park theough security was absurd. I appreciate the safety measures but you have to design the entrance to keep things moving smoothly. Sitting in the rain with toddlers is not enjoyable. If we are going to commit to you park in the rain, try and make your guests comfortable. Get more lanes or a better system. Also SO many rides were down. There should be a voucher for another day if a certain amount of rides arent running or if the entire day is rainy."",Disneyland_California"
"4,4,2021-2,France,""smaller than its US counterpart but Disneyland never disappoints regardless of whether you're an adult or a child ! The access from Paris is with line A, with a ticket cost around 8€ and a trip during around 30min so it's easily doable in a day-trip if you're staying in Paris center"",Disneyland_Paris"
"5,1,2020-8,Germany,""Worst service ever in the world. I booked the dated tickets in the month of Aug 2020 and not able to travel because of corona restrictions. I called customer care (after 4 hrs being on Hold) finally spoke with a customer agent. She confirmed to refund my tickets, however, asked me to send an email and I sent. It's been more than 10 days no reply. And not able to connect to customer care again. Worst worst worst service."",Disneyland_Paris"
"6,3,2020-6,United Kingdom,""Great day. Limited rides compared to other disneyland. Queue depends on popularity of rides. No great selection of “disney” food/drinks. Outside are restaurants- great for post disney trip! Train station nearby."",Disneyland_Paris"
"7,2,2019-5,China,""the cast members here must hate their jobs, hate the guests, or both? Walt Disney's vision for Disneyland is happy alternate reality where you can go to cheer up and be around cheerful people. HK Disneyland is not that. You can go just to say you've been, or to collect pins or get limited edition souvenirs that you can probably get at the HKG Disney store at the Food Court by Departures when you leave Hong Kong. Go to Tokyo Disneyland, or save up and go to Anaheim California. Having gone three times in three years, I won't be going back ..."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"8,3,2020-11,United Kingdom,""the park was rather small, we finished the visit within two hours. The items we wanted to see were not there."",Disneyland_HongKong"
"9,4,2021-1,China,""the place was too crowded with tourist, but didn't mind coz I went there during the Christmas season, I still enjoyed my time going there. took lots of photos, had some ride (some rides has long queue), watched some shows and the fireworks at night and ate. Disneyland is best for group of youngsters, family and couple or young-at-heart people!"",Disneyland_HongKong"
"10,1,2019-10,Australia,""We of course prepaid tickets. Thinking we were saving money and missing the lines. So the day we booked to go it was a Typhoon cat. 1. (Really just overcast and a little wind). Once at the gate to enter we were informed 90% of the rides were shut. Weather of course are not in the control of Disney but no compensation for shutting rides. We paid full price and being food is $25aus for a hamburger we would of expected some small token. Like 20%discount food eg. As well as the famous Disney castle was under construction. You dont hear about that on the website do YOU.and being that the rides were closed so too were 40% of food outlets. So total ripe off. Thanks Disney you really got your money out of us..."",Disneyland_HongKong"
